/** @file phash.h
	@brief A simple dictionary library for storing pointers.

	A phash doesn't actually store any data for the key or the value, merely
	pointers to them.  The in-memory data must persist until the phash is
	destroyed.  If a memory location referred to by a phash is free'd, or
	non-malloc'd pointers simply go out of scope the phash will almost definitely
	try to access invalid memory locations during a call to any function except
	for phash_destroy.  String literals, depending on the compiler, generally
	get put into some kind of read-only memory and persist through the program,
	so they might be safe.
