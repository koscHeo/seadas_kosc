$Log: imsl_d_spline_value.c,v $
Revision 4.4  2003/08/28 16:05:59  kuyper
Corrected prolog.

  values.

Revision 4.2  2003/07/26 16:33:36  kuyper
Changed interv() to assume that calls come in non-decreasing order.
Changed imsl_d_spline_value() to validate that xvec is increasing.
Corrected sign error in bvalue().
Changed to return IMSL_SPLINE_ORDER_DERIV for bad values of deriv.
Corrected imsl_d_spline_value() to set IMSL_error_code after call to
  imsl_d_machine(), which re-sets the code.

Revision 4.1  2003/07/16 18:11:10  kuyper
Created by reverse engineering from documentation and testing of the real
IMSL library routine.

!C
!Description:   
	Sets left to the maximum value for i such that
		xt[i] < xt[lxt-1] && xt[i] <= x

!Input Parameters:
	xt	A double array of length lxt, assumed to be non-decreasing.
	lxt	Number of elements in the array xt.
	x	The point whose location with respect to the sequence xt is to
		be determined.

!Output Parameters:
	None

!Input/Output Parameters:
	left	On input, points to an initial guess, assumed to be
		non-negative, for the final value to be written over that guess.
		This code assumes 0<= *left < lxt.
		On output, the int that it points at is set to:
		0 if x < xt[0]
		i if xt[i] <= x < xt[i+1]
		i if xt[i] < x < xt[i+1]  == xt[lxt1-1]
		i if xt[i] < xt[i+1] == xt[lxt-1] < x

	The asymmetric treatment of the intervals is due to the decision to
	make all pp functions continuous from the right.
		

Return Value:
	-1	if x < xt[0]
	1	if xt[lxt-1] < x	
	0	otherwise	(the usual case)

	By returning 0 even if x==xt[lxt-1], there is the option of having the
	computed pp function continuous from the left at xt[lxt].

References and Credits
	This routine is based loosley upon the Fortran routine of the same name
	as described by Carl de Boor in "A Practical Guide to Splines - Revised
	Edition", 2001. The original routine can be found in interv.f, which is
	part of the pppack package which can be downloaded from
	<ftp://netlib.bell-labs.com/netlib/pppack.tar>

Design Notes
	The function is designed to be efficient in the common situation that
	it is called repeatedly, with x taken from an increasing sequence. This
	will happen, e.g., when a pp function is to be graphed.  The first guess
	pointed at by 'left' should  therefore normally be the value returned
	through that same parameter from the previous call. Then, if
	xt[ilo] <= x < xt[ilo+1], we set left = ilo and are done after just
	three comparisons.
	Otherwise, we repeatedly double the difference istep = ihi - ilo while
	also moving ihi in the direction of x, until
		xt[ilo] <= x < xt[ihi]
	after which we use bisection to get, in addition, ilo+1 = ihi.
	*left = ilo is then returned.

	This version differs from the original in that *left is used to
	initialize ilo, rather than making ilo static. This allows multiple
	different searches through different tables (or even the same table) to
	alternate with each other without interference. More importantly, it
	allows *left to be externally re-initialized when the table changes.
	Since it is externally initialized, *left is assumet to always be in a
	valid range for the current table. Finally, it is assumed that each
	table is accessed in increasing order.

Design Notes
	This is a port to C of the FORTRAN routine named bvalue() described in
	de Boor (2001). That routine is provided in the bvalue.f file which is
	part of the pppack package which can be downloaded from the netlib web
	site listed above.

	The nontrivial knot interval t[i], t[i+1] containing x is located with
	the aid of interv(). The k b-coeffs of f relevant for this interval are
	then obtained from bcoef (or taken to be zero if not explicitly
	available) and are then differenced jderiv times to obtain the b-coeffs
	of (d**jderiv)f relevant for that interval. Precisely, with j=jderiv,
	we have from X.12 of de Boors (2001) that

		(d**j)f = sum ( bcoef[.,j]*b[.,k-j,t] )

	where

			    | bcoef[.]			     j==0
			    |
		bcoef[.,j] =| bcoef[.,j-1] - bcoef[.-1,j-1]
			    | -----------------------------, j > 0
			    |    (t[.+k-j] - t[.])/(k-j)

	Then, we use repeatedly the fact that

	sum( a[.]*b[.,m,t](x) )  = sum(a[.,x]*b[.,m-1,t](x) )

	with

		 (x - t[.])*a[.] + (t[.+m-1] - x)*a[.-1]
	a[.,x] = ---------------------------------------
		 (x - t[.])      + (t[.+m-1] - x)

	to write (d**j)f(x) eventually as a linear combination of b-splines of
	order 1, and the coefficient for b[i,1,t](x) must then be the desired
	number (d**j)f(x). (See X.17-X.19 of de Boors (2001)).

	This function makes many unchecked assumptions, including both the ones
	explicitly mentioned above, and the assumption that its pointer
	arguments are valid. The validity of those assumptions is the
	responsibility of the calling function. Therefore, this function has
	been made static, so it can only be called by other functions in the
	same file. This will make it easier to verify that the the calling
	function fulfills its responsibility.

Design Notes
	This function is a wrapper for a modified C version of the Fortran
	bvalue() function described in de Boor (2001).

	The interface is intended to mimic a subset of the features of the
	correspondingly named IMSL library function. That will allow us to make
	the use of the actual IMSL library optional, without requiring a
	re-write of the code that uses the function. 

	This function's interface differs from that of the real
	imsl_d_spline_value() in that the IMSL_GRID option is not supported.
