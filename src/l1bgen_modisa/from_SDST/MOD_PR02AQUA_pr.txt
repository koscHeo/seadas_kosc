MOD_PR02AQUA Production Rules:
--------------------------

MOD_PR02AQUA executes once for each 5 minute granule of MYD01 produced by
PGE01, where MYD is the prefix denoting AQUA file output. The total, nominal
number of executions is 288 per day.

Each execution requires:
------------------------

   Input File Characterization:
   ----------------------------

   MOD_PR02AQUA normally ingests three 5-minute granules of MYD01 data
   (previous, current, and following) and one granule of MYD03 data
   (synchronized with the current MYD01 granule).  The current MYD01
   granule and the MYD03 granule are required.  If the previous MYD01
   granule and/or following MYD01 granule are not available at execution
   time for the current granule, then MOD_PR02AQUA may be executed without
   the missing MYD01 granules.  To enable execution in the event of a
   missing previous MYD01 granule (LUN 500000) or a following MYD01
   granule (LUN 500002), omit the appropriate LUN(s) from the PCF.

   Ancillary Data Needs: (none)
   ---------------------

   Static File Needs:
   ------------------

   MOD_PR02AQUA requires calibration parameters lookup tables (LUTs).  These
   consist of three files in HDF format:
   (1) MYD02_Reflective_LUTs.hdf.coeff,
   (2) MYD02_Emissive_LUTs.hdf.coeff, and
   (3) MYD02_QA_LUTs.hdf.coeff.
   
   (The ".coeff" extension is added to conform to DAAC file naming convention.)

   Output Product Characterization:
   --------------------------------

   MOD_PR02AQUA produces the following output granules, in HDF format, which
   correspond to the temporal boundaries of the current MYD01 input granule:
   (1) MYD021KM:  MODIS/xxxxx Calibrated Radiances 5-Min L1B Swath 1km
   (2) MYD02HKM:  MODIS/xxxxx Calibrated Radiances 5-Min L1B Swath 500m
   (3) MYD02QKM:  MODIS/xxxxx Calibrated Radiances 5-Min L1B Swath 250m, and
   (4) MYD02OBC:  MODIS/xxxxx On-Board Calibrator and Engineering Data
                  5-Min L1B where xxxxx = Terra or Aqua.

   Associated with each of the above HDF products is an ASCII metadata
   (".met") file that contains only the ECS inventory metadata for each
   product.
