ice2hdf <northFile> <southFile> <outputHDF>

This program takes a NSIDC north and south ice file and puts the data
into an HDF file that l2gen can use as input.  All missing data is filled.


--------------------------------
NRT data source:

Documentation web site: 
http://nsidc.org/data/docs/daac/nsidc0051_gsfc_seaice.gd.html

FTP site: 
ftp://sidads.colorado.edu/pub/DATASETS/seaice/polar-stereo/nasateam/near-real-time/
(north and south directories)


Naming convention:

nt_yyyymmdd_aaa_nrt_x.bin

yyyy = year
mm   = month
dd   = day of month
aaa  = satalite ID (f13, f15, f17) if duplicate dates use the biggest number
x    = north or south (n,s)

example file name

nt_20080101_f15_nrt_s.bin




--------------------------------
There is also a program to create an ice fraction climotology file from the
monthly data:

make_monthly_ice_hdf.pro

This IDL program that will take a directory full of monthly NSIDC ice 
north and south files and create an HDF file that l2gen can use for 
monthly/climatology ice fraction ancillary data.  All missing data is filled.

The program source is located at

svn://svn0.domain.sdps/TOOLS/anc/ice

The ouput climotology file is usually stored in:

$OCSSWROOT/data/common/ice_fraction.hdf



--------------------------------
File selection criteria

For operations the closest NRT file within 2 weeks should be used before
falling back on the new climotology which needs to be specified on the 
command line or the old climotology will be used.
