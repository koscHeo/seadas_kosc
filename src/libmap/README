NOTE(V5.0): In this version, the values 'median' and 'mode' have been 
		removed for attribute 'Measure'.  The byte values for
	 	Nodata pixels are set to 255.  Valid byte value = 0 to 254.
		

NOTE(V4.4):In this version, palette has been removed from the interface call & 
	has been defined in an include file.  Added input arguments orbit
	and flag_names to put_l3m call.  Added them as global attributes.
	Added output argument "orbit" to get_l3m call.  
	Changed the eps_68 to eps_78.

      SeaWiFS LEVEL-3 STANDARD MAPPED DATA WRITE AND READ ROUTINES
			    (Version 5.0)	

This set of routines is comprised of Level-3 standard mapped data write and
read routines and associated include files  in /include and test files in 
/test sub directories.  The files are as follow:

put_l3m.c : Standard Map Image output functions
get_l3m.c : Standard Map Image Input functions
Makefile  : to build SMI I/O library
/include  
	map.h     : defins some constants, include files and l3m meta 
		    structure 
	mapattr.h : defines all the global attributes 
	maplists.h: defines some global variables
 	mapproto.h: defines prototypes of all the functions 
	palette.h : defines map_palette
/test	  
	README    : Gives information about test directory and how to build
	 	    the test tools
	Makefile  : to build "putl3m" and "getl3m" test tools
	tput_l3m.c: output test routine
	tget_l3m.c: input test routine
	daily.hdf : sample level 3 daily bin file (input data file)
	map_palette.h: a palette file

The data file that gets created using this library will be in HDF format and 
follows the Level-3 Standard Mapped data specifications given in "SeaWiFS 
Operational Archive Product Specification", v2.8, by F.S. Patt, 
J.K.Firestone, B. Schieber, L. Kumar, D. Ilg, and M. Darzi.  

The interfaces to the routines are given in the specifications for Level-3 
Standard Mapped data write and read routines given in "Interface 
Specifications for SeaWiFS Operational Product Input, Output, and Sensor 
Calibration Software", v4.4, by F.S. Patt, J.K. Firestone, and M. Darzi.
