src mods
- swl0_parms.h, version number updated.
- getorbnum.c, maintainence update to orbit number table.
- swl1_hdf.h, fix mismatched string length for code.

4.0.7 	17 April 2006

Maintainence update. Fix for large time-shift in recent GPS outage.

src mods
- swl0_parms.h, version number updated.
- getorbnum.c, maintainence update to orbit number table.

libswfnav
- proctim2.f, fix part of the GPS outage period.

4.1 	11 June 2006

Revised orbit number determination based on externalized table, so
we don't have to keep changing the code.

src mods
- swl0_parms.h, version number updated.
- getorbnum.c, externalized orbit number table.

data
- seawifs/cal/orbit_table.dat, new seawifs orbit table.

4.1.1 	31 July 2006

Fix sscanf to use %hd for INT16, for OSX.

src mods
- swl0_parms.h, version number updated.
- getorbnum.c, externalized orbit number table.

4.2	17 July 2007

Change SWl0info to report earliest and latest scan times in file.

src mods
- swl0_struc.h, added timeFirst, timeLast fields.
- getl0indx.c, compute timeFirst, timeLast.
- printindx.c, print Start_Time and Stop_Time as timeFirst, timeLast.

4.3	30 October 2007

Navigation library was modified to compute attitude, if possible, 
when the navflags are set externally to indicate bad navigation
(e.g., by the temporal_anomaly file). This was done to allow proper
atmospheric correction for the browse files.

libswfnav
- attcmp.f, swf_tel.f, swfnav.f


4.4	3 January 2008

Due to problems with SeaWiFS navigation telem, code was modified to 
to handle extrapolation of orbit vectors. 

src
- swl0_parms.h, version number change. Change MINORBVEC to 0.
- getorbdata.c, added dummy last record to extend orbit integeration
  time to last good mnf time (not last good GPS time).
- getl0scene_nav.c, allow processing to proceed with 0 GPS vectors.

libswfnav
- read_gps.f, echo end time of integration period.

4.5	21 August 2008

Add explicit test for endian. Use new libgenutils for swapc_bytes,
parse_file_name, and time utilities.

src
- swl0_parms.h, version number change. 
- getl1rec.c, replace ifdef linux with endianess().
- getorbdata.c, replace ifdef linux with endianess().
