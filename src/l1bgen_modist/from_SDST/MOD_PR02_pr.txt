MOD_PR02 Production Rules:
--------------------------

MOD_PR02 executes once for each 5 minute granule of MxD01 produced by PGE01,
where MxD stands for MOD (Terra files) or MYD (Aqua files).
The total, nominal number of executions is 288 per day.

Each execution requires:
------------------------

   Input File Characterization:
   ----------------------------

   MOD_PR02 normally ingests three 5-minute granules of MxD01 data
   (previous, current, and following) and one granule of MxD03 data
   (synchronized with the current MxD01 granule).  The current MxD01
   granule and the MxD03 granule are required.  If the previous MxD01
   granule and/or following MxD01 granule are not available at execution
   time for the current granule, then MOD_PR02 may be executed without
   the missing MxD01 granules.  To enable execution in the event of a
   missing previous MxD01 granule (LUN 500000) or a following MxD01
   granule (LUN 500002), omit the appropriate LUN(s) from the PCF.

   Ancillary Data Needs: (none)
   ---------------------

   Static File Needs:
   ------------------

   MOD_PR02 requires calibration parameters lookup tables (LUTs).  These
   consist of three files in HDF format:
   (1) MxD02_Reflective_LUTs.hdf.coeff,
   (2) MxD02_Emissive_LUTs.hdf.coeff, and
   (3) MxD02_QA_LUTs.hdf.coeff.
   
   (The ".coeff" extension is added to conform to DAAC file naming convention.)

   Output Product Characterization:
   --------------------------------

   MOD_PR02 produces the following output granules, in HDF format, which
   correspond to the temporal boundaries of the current MxD01 input granule:
   (1) MxD021KM:  MODIS/xxxxx Calibrated Radiances 5-Min L1B Swath 1km
   (2) MxD02HKM:  MODIS/xxxxx Calibrated Radiances 5-Min L1B Swath 500m
   (3) MxD02QKM:  MODIS/xxxxx Calibrated Radiances 5-Min L1B Swath 250m, and
   (4) MxD02OBC:  MODIS/xxxxx On-Board Calibrator and Engineering Data 5-Min L1B
   where x = "O" for Terra data, "Y" for Aqua data, and xxxxx = Terra or Aqua
   respectively.

   Associated with each of the above HDF products is an ASCII metadata
   (".met") file that contains only the ECS inventory metadata for each
   product.
